Project Description: Stock Management System

The Stock Management System is a Java-based application that allows users, primarily sellers, to manage their inventory, monitor transactions, and interact with suppliers. The system provides a user-friendly command-line interface where sellers can perform various tasks related to their stock, such as buying new products from suppliers, updating product details, selling products to customers, and monitoring transaction records.

Key Features:

Supplier Management: The system enables sellers to manage their suppliers by adding new suppliers to the database or updating the details of existing suppliers. Each supplier is associated with a unique name, phone number, and email address.

Product Management: Sellers can add new products to their inventory, update product details such as price and quantity, and monitor the current stock status of each product. Each product is identified by a unique product ID, and its name, price, and quantity are recorded.

Purchasing: Sellers can purchase products from registered suppliers by providing the product details such as name, ID, price, and quantity. The system automatically updates the inventory with the purchased products and stores the transaction details in a record file.

Selling: Sellers can sell products to customers by specifying the product's ID and the quantity sold. The system deducts the sold quantity from the inventory and records the transaction, including the selling price and date, in the record file.

Transaction Monitoring: Sellers can view transaction records, including details of each purchase and sale, such as transaction IDs, product information, quantities, prices, and transaction dates. This helps sellers keep track of their business activities.

Warehouse Details: The system provides a summary of the current stock status of all products in the warehouse, including product names, IDs, prices, quantities, and total product prices.

Supplier Details: Sellers can view the list of registered suppliers along with their respective contact information, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses.

The project utilizes object-oriented programming principles, encapsulation, and file handling to efficiently manage stock-related tasks. It helps sellers maintain accurate inventory records, make informed business decisions, and facilitate smooth interactions with suppliers and customers.

Please note that the project is designed as a command-line application, and further improvements and enhancements can be made to extend its functionality and create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) if required.
